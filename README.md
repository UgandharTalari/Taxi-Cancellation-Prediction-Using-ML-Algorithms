# Taxi-Cancellation-Prediction-Using-ML-Algorithms
The data-frame is about classifying the cancellation of the taxi booking in which the data consists of features regarding the different users and the trip details, there features are used get output of classification problem.

This project aims to predict taxi booking demand using Python and various machine learning algorithms. Key components of the project include:

Data Collection: Utilizing a dataset containing historical taxi booking records, including features such as time of day, weather conditions, geographical locations, and special events.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables to prepare it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize trends and patterns in taxi bookings, helping to identify key factors influencing demand.
Model Development: Implementing various machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict the number of taxi bookings at different times and locations.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² Score to select the most accurate predictive model.
